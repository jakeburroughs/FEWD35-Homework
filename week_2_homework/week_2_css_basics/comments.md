Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Good work on the about me page. Make sure you title it as "About Me" so its not confused with the resume page. Also make sure you include a separate file when you begin work on the resume portion of the homework.

Visually your code is pretty ogranized, just make sure its clear that everything inside the 'body' tag are children of it. 

Don't forget to do the resume portion! 

Keep up the great work!
